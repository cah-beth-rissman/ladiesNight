 - Closet Refresher
 - My other idea is for a Clothing exchange. Children's clothing can be exchanged for a size up. 
 - Women can exchange clothes to rotate outfits and refresh their wardrobe on a regular basis. 
 - Teens can exchange prom/homecoming outfits. Men can exchange ties. (Just kidding.) 

You can swipe left for outfits you are passing on, swipe right for outfits you like.

### Summary of idea 3
1. What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)
 - Adopt a Senior
 - I have an idea for an adopt-a-senior program. It's kind of like the city program, 'Snow Buddies' that pairs seniors and people 
 - with disabilities with neighbors who can help with snow removal. This would be more broad and can help seniors with other things 
 - they may need outside of snow removal. It could be year-round and include lawn care or general things like grocery shopping or just 
 - visiting and having tea or coffee. It would include a form where volunteers can sign up and select what activities they are offering help.

 - Photography Catalog
 - I have a project for when I'm done from a friend, so am not sure if it would be appropriate to propose it here. He was hoping 
 - (after graduation) that I would be able to help him with putting his extensive catalog of photographs either on his website or 
 - a website for that singular purpose. I've been thinking about it for awhile and trying to think of ways to file them so someone 
 - could search and if there would be a way to do that without having to physically categorize them one by one.
